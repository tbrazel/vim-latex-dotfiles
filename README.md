# vim-latex-snippets
These are snippets that I use for live-TeXing with Vim + LaTeX.

I am using [MacVim](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim) together with [Skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/) as a PDF viewer. My dotfiles can be found [here](https://github/com/tbrazel/dotfiles).

Snippets are written using [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips).

I am always looking for ways to optimize my workflow, so I welcome pull requests with suggestions for LaTeX snippets.
